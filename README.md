# Volvo Pedal Commander

DRAFT

Bought my car (Volvo V50 T5) second hand from a guy who had put a tune in it. This resulted in an amazing car but with a little (too) agrassive gaspedal.

Discoverd device called "Pedal Commander" exists and by a few diffrent manufacturers: Pedal Commander, Pedal Box, Sprint Booster, 9 Drive, etc.
Thought about buying one of those devices, but because these devices are more aimed at making the gas pedal of a car more agressive. 
With the exeption of a ECO mode on some devices and beacause i have some quistions about the way these cheap chinese pedal changing boxes are handeling the verification signal.
Made plans to make my own.

I'm sure with proper tuning software you would be able to change the throttle remapping or something, i wanted to try this first.

quickly came to the conclusion that all these devieces are aimed at 
bla bla dont trust
