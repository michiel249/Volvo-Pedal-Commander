# Volvo Pedal Commander

DRAFT

Bought my car second hand from a guy who had put a tune in it. This resulted in an amazing car but with a bit agrassive gaspedal.
I'm sure with proper tuning software you would be able to change the throttle remapping or something, i wanted to try this first.

Discoverd device called "Pedal Commander" exists and by a few diffrent manufacturers.
