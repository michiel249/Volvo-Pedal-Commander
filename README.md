# Volvo Pedal Commander

Draft: Bought my car (Volvo V50 T5) second hand from a guy who had put a tune in it. This resulted in an amazing car but with a little (too) agrassive gaspedal.

Discoverd a device called "Pedal Commander" exists and by a few diffrent manufacturers: Pedal Commander, Pedal Box, Sprint Booster, 9 Drive, etc.
Thought about buying one of those devices, but because these devices are more aimed at making the gas pedal of a car more agressive. 
With the exeption of a ECO mode on some devices. 
And beacause i have some questions about the way these cheap chinese pedal changing boxes are handeling the redundant signals of the gas pedal.
Made plans to make my own.

I'm sure with proper tuning software you would be able to change the throttle remapping or something, i wanted to try this first.

## The plan:

Take a Arduino, a MCP4725 DAC, Volvo Gas Pedal Male and Female connetors slap all of them together.
write code..
make curve in throttle signal. Happy driving

Working on a version 0.1 with above draft, took few hours for me to get the pedal to spit out PWM, taped it all together. 
Wrote code that should send signals out as they come in (transparent). First challenge!
Gas pedal pulse width modulated signal is 200hz. default PWM signal of my Arduino Nano is not.

Now trying to get my arduino to spit out 200hz PWM :) it is quite a low frequency so it should be no problem

Here we go.

p.s. Just realized this probably is going to introduce a 0.005+ second delay in from receiving the signal to sending. Outback Joe mentioned these devices always have the drawback of adding some delay. This is that with the addition of needing to calculats a new signal.
